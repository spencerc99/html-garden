          This garden was planted by{" "}
          <a href="https://www.spencerchang.me/">Spencer Chang</a> for the 2nd
          issue of <a href="http://html.review/">thehtml.review</a>

          <em>html garden</em> is an attempt to imagine what a &quot;seasonal
          website&quot; looks like, one that rewards visitors for coming back
          and&nbsp;<em>noticing</em>, an act very different from the normal way
          change takes effect via large platforms forcing an interface change. I
          wanted to give the power of agency back to the viewer, where the
          website subtly changes and grows day to day, but the viewer&apos;s
          agency is always maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>html garden</em> is composed of digitally-native plants, formed
          from HTML elements that simulate the growth patterns of real plants
          (backed by a grammar that means you could create your own plant!).
          Visiting repeatedly will reward you with the sights of growth in each
          plant along with budding offspring, and you might just find new
          species as you come to become a regular at this neighborhood garden.

          This was such a joy (and at times an absolute struggle) to create,
          play with, and learn from, from not only creating a poetic website,
          with all the interactions and details that delight, but also creating
          a system on top of{" "}

          logic of l-systems.
